# Description
A Flutter app that displays a list of users by fetching data from a public API. The app shows each userâ€™s name and email, with additional functionality for refreshing, error handling, searching and a clean UI. This project demonstrates API integration, state management, and Flutter's UI capabilities.

# Features
API Integration: Fetches user data from API.
Loading Indicator: Displays a loading spinner while data is being fetched.

Error Handling: Displays an error message if data cannot be fetched.
Detail Screen: Shows more details about the user when a list item is tapped (Bonus feature).

# User Details AppScrip

# Description
A Flutter app that displays a list of users by fetching data from a public API. The app shows each userâ€™s name and email, with additional functionality for refreshing, error handling, and a clean UI. This project demonstrates API integration, state management, and Flutter's UI capabilities.

# Features
API Integration: Fetches user data from API.
Loading Indicator: Displays a loading spinner while data is being fetched.
Pull-to-Refresh: Allows users to refresh the list by swipping down.
Error Handling: Displays an error message if data cannot be fetched.
Detail Screen: Shows more details about the user when a list item is tapped (Bonus feature).

# Decisions
  Used Bloc for state management to handle API calls, loading states, and error messages efficiently.
  Implemented a detail screen as a bonus feature, assuming users may want additional information.

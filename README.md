# User Details AppScrip

## Description
A Flutter app that displays a list of users by fetching data from a public API. The app shows each userâ€™s name and email, with additional functionality for refreshing, error handling, searching, and a clean UI. This project demonstrates API integration, state management, and Flutter's UI capabilities.

## Features
- **API Integration**: Fetches user data from a public API.
- **Loading Indicator**: Displays a loading spinner while data is being fetched.
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Allows users to refresh the list by swiping down.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if data cannot be fetched.
- **Detail Screen**: Shows more details about the user when a list item is tapped (Bonus feature).
- **Search Functionality**: Search field for finding users by name or email (Bonus feature).

## Decisions
- Used BLoC for state management to handle API calls, loading states, and error messages efficiently.
- Implemented a detail screen as a bonus feature, assuming users may want additional information.
